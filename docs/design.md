# Kada Design

Kada is a short-link management and analytics platform. Users create short links, organise them, and
watch how they are clicked. This document explains how the system is put together and why.

## 1. Product summary

| Capability | Notes |
|---|---|
| Authentication | Phone + SMS code behind a graphical challenge, JWT bearer token for the API |
| Links | Create, edit, disable, expire, password protect, batch delete and batch tag |
| Organisation | Folders, tags, workspaces |
| Custom domains | DNS TXT ownership verification before a domain can serve links |
| Analytics | Click totals, daily trend, platform breakdown, visitor list, raw event log |
| Integrations | UTM templates, QR codes, CSV export, personal API tokens |
| AI assistant | RAG over the project knowledge base, tools that run as the signed-in user |
| Presentation | Bilingual UI (Chinese / English), light and dark themes |

The primary tension in the design is that **redirection is hot and analytics is cold**. Following a
short link must be fast and must not fail because a database is busy, while counting clicks is
allowed to lag by a second. The architecture is split along that line.

Components:

| Component | Process | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `cmd/server` | `backend` | HTTP API, short-link redirection, publishes click events |
| `cmd/worker` | `kafka-worker` | Consumes the `clicks` topic and persists click rows |
| `cmd/migrate` | one-off | Applies the database schema (GORM AutoMigrate) |
| `frontend` | `frontend` | Vite single-page app, served as static files; talks to the API over HTTP only |
| `postgres` | `postgres` | Source of truth; also the analytics store |
| `redis` | `redis` | Short-code cache and rate-limit counters |
| `kafka` | `kafka` | Durable buffer between request handling and click persistence |
| `nginx` | `nginx` | Single entry point, routes `/api/` and `/r/` to the API |

There is exactly one writer of the database schema (see
[4.4 Schema ownership](#44-schema-ownership)) and no service talks to another service's database.
The frontend never touches PostgreSQL or Redis.

## 4. Backend

### 4.1 Layering

```text
HTTP request
   │
   ▼
middleware        JWT validation, API-token validation, rate limiting, client IP
   │
   ▼
handler/<res>     bind + validate JSON, map service errors to HTTP status
   │  depends on a small interface it declares itself, so it can be tested with a fake
   ▼
service/<res>     business rules, ownership checks, transactions, cache invalidation
   │  depends on *gorm.DB
   ▼
domain/entity     database rows
```

Rules that keep this honest:

- A handler never touches the database. It declares the slice of the service it needs as an
  interface (`handler/auth.AuthService`), which is why handler tests need no database.
- A service never touches `*gin.Context`. It takes `context.Context` plus plain values.
- Ownership is enforced in the service by putting `user_id` into the `WHERE` clause, never by
  trusting an ID that arrived from the client.
- Errors returned by services are safe to show to a user. Internal details stay in the logs.

### 4.2 Request path

`cmd/server/main.go` is the only place where the object graph is built. It creates the database
handle, Redis client, SMS sender, cache service, Kafka publisher, then every service, then every
handler, and finally registers routes:

```go
v1 := r.Group("/api")
authH.RegisterRoutes(v1, authMW, strictMW)
linkH.RegisterRoutes(v1, authMW)
// ...
```

Each handler owns its own route table (`RegisterRoutes`), so adding a resource means adding one
package and one line in `main.go`, not editing a central route list.

Public endpoints that do not require a session (`/api/auth/*`, `/r/:code`) are registered inside the
handler without the auth middleware; everything else is grouped behind it.

The Python AI service is the one exception, and it is not registered here at all: `/api/ai/*` is a
reverse proxy (`internal/handler/ai`) that authenticates the caller, injects the user id, and forwards
to the AI service with its own mount prefix stripped (`/api/ai/conversations/current` ->
`/conversations/current`). The Python service owns its own paths and knows nothing about `/api/ai`, so
the two surfaces can move independently - and, as everywhere else in this project, no `/v1` appears in a
URL: the `v1` in the snippet above is a variable name.

### 4.3 Short-link resolution

Redirection has its own hot path that deliberately avoids PostgreSQL:

```text
GET /r/:code
   │
   ├─ Redis cache hit ──► serve
   │
   └─ miss ──► SELECT ... WHERE short_code = $1 AND is_active
                 │
                 ├─ expired?      ──► error page
                 ├─ has password? ──► password page / verify
                 ├─ platform needs a guide page? ──► intermediate page with deeplinks
                 └─ otherwise     ──► 302 to the target
```

The result is written back to Redis with a TTL, and every mutation (update, delete, batch delete,
workspace delete) invalidates the affected short codes. This is a cache-aside pattern; PostgreSQL
remains the source of truth and a cold cache only costs latency.

### 4.4 Schema ownership

The schema is defined by the GORM models in `internal/domain/entity` and applied with `AutoMigrate`; the
migration SQL files are gone. `cmd/migrate` applies the models (`cd backend && go run ./cmd/migrate/`), and
the API server applies them on startup **only** when `DB_AUTO_MIGRATE=true`, so in production a restart
cannot change the database as a side effect.

AutoMigrate is additive: it creates missing tables, columns, indexes and constraints, and never drops
anything. That makes it safe on an existing installation, and it means a rollback to an older binary leaves
the newer columns in place. It also means the models are **not** the whole truth about a database that
predates them: whatever the original raw-SQL schema declared and the models no longer mention stays exactly
as it was, constraints included. Two rounds of that have cost real time:

- A UNIQUE constraint under PostgreSQL's generated name (`users_phone_key`) aborted the whole migration,
  because AutoMigrate tried to drop a constraint derived from the model that did not exist yet. Hence
  `ReconcileLegacyConstraints`.
- `sms_codes.code` was declared NOT NULL back when codes were stored as text. The service stores only
  `sha256(code)` and never writes that column, so the leftover rule rejected every insert with
  `SQLSTATE 23502` - and that insert runs *after* the SMS has been sent. The recipient got a code, the form
  answered "failed to store verification code", and because no row was written the per-phone cooldown could
  never match one, so every retry reached the provider until it answered with a rate limit. Hence
  `ReconcileLegacyColumns`.

Both run inside `infra.Migrate` before `AutoMigrate`, both are written as idempotent DDL, and neither
touches a table that does not exist, so a fresh database is unaffected. The old golang-migrate bookkeeping
table `schema_migrations` may still sit in a database created before the switch; nothing reads or writes it.
The lesson the code keeps: an existing database is a second source of truth, and the only way to reconcile
it is explicitly.

Raw SQL is still used where a single statement is the point — the atomic verification-code consume,
the idempotent click insert, bulk insert-selects — and each of those sites is commented as such.

### 4.5 Error mapping

| Situation | HTTP |
|---|---|
| Invalid or missing body | 400 |
| No or invalid token | 401 |
| Code or password rejected | 401 |
| Not the owner / duplicate resource | 403 / 409 |
| Unknown resource | 404 |
| Rate limited | 429 |
| Anything unexpected | 500, with a generic message |

Services return sentinel errors for the cases a handler must distinguish (for example
`domain.ErrEmailTaken`), and wrap everything else with context so the log explains the failure while
the response does not.

## 5. Data model

```text
users ──┬── links ──┬── click_logs
        │           └── link_tags ── tags
        ├── folders ──┘ (links.folder_id)
        ├── workspaces ─┘ (links.workspace_id)
        ├── domains
        ├── utm_templates
        └── api_tokens

sms_codes       (standalone, keyed by phone)
login_captchas  (standalone, keyed by id)
```

| Table | Purpose | Notable columns |
|---|---|---|
| `users` | Accounts | `phone` (unique, and the whole profile); `email`, `name`, `avatar`, `password_hash`, `wechat_openid` are retained legacy columns nothing reads |
| `links` | Short links | `short_code` (unique), `original_url`, `domain`, `password_hash`, `expires_at`, `is_active`, `click_count` |
| `click_logs` | One row per click | `platform`, `ip`, `referer`, `event_id` (unique, idempotency) |
| `folders`, `tags`, `link_tags` | Organisation | `link_tags` is a plain junction table |
| `workspaces` | Team/project grouping | `slug` (unique), `links.workspace_id` |
| `domains` | Custom domains | `verified`, unique per `(user_id, name)` |
| `utm_templates` | Reusable UTM sets | `utm_*` columns |
| `api_tokens` | Programmatic access | `token_hash` (unique); the raw token is shown once |
| `sms_codes` | Pending SMS logins | `code_hash` (sha256), `ip` (per-IP quotas), `attempts`, `expires_at`; the plaintext code is never stored |
| `login_captchas` | Pending graphical challenges | `code_hash` (sha256 of the upper-cased answer), `attempts`, `expires_at` |

Design rules:

- **Passwords are never stored in a form that can be replayed.** Account and link passwords use
  bcrypt; SMS codes, captchas and API tokens are stored as SHA-256 hashes, and the plaintext of a
  one-time secret is never written to the database or the log.
- **The graphical challenge lives in PostgreSQL, not Redis.** Redis is optional in this deployment - the
  rate limiter fails open when it is down - and a captcha that silently stops being enforced is worse than
  no captcha, because the endpoint still looks protected. The database is not optional.
- **Deletion semantics are explicit.** Deleting a user cascades to their folders, tags, domains,
  templates and tokens, but only detaches links (`ON DELETE SET NULL`) so public links do not vanish.
  Deleting a folder or workspace detaches its links. Deleting a link cascades to its click logs.
- **Timestamps are UTC** (`timestamptz`); the frontend formats for display.

## 6. Frontend

A Vite single-page app built to static files, with React Router for the routes. The dashboard is highly
interactive, so there was never a server-rendered page to gain from; removing the Node process removed a
service, its systemd unit and a whole deployment step with it.

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `/` | Landing page with the animated starfield |
| `/login` | Sign-in: phone number, graphical challenge, SMS code, privacy consent |
| `/register` | Redirects to `/login`: a new phone number is registered on the spot |
| `/privacy` | Privacy policy, linked from the consent checkbox before sign-in |
| `/dashboard` | Overview: totals, trend, recent links |
| `/dashboard/links`, `/new`, `/[id]` | Link list, creation form, detail/edit |
| `/dashboard/analytics`, `/events`, `/customers` | Click analytics, raw events, visitors |
| `/dashboard/folders`, `/tags`, `/domains`, `/utm`, `/settings` | Organisation and account settings |
| `/r/[code]` | Client-side fallback page for a short code |

Data fetching uses SWR against `src/lib/api.ts`, which is the single place where the API surface is
declared and where the bearer token is attached. Components never call `fetch` directly.

State that must survive a reload (session token, profile, locale) lives in `localStorage` behind
helpers in `src/lib/auth.ts` and `src/lib/i18n`.

### 6.1 Internationalisation

The UI ships in Chinese and English. The dictionary is keyed by the **Chinese source string**:

```tsx
const t = useT();
return <button>{t("创建链接")}</button>;
```

- `zh` is the identity map, so an untranslated key degrades to readable Chinese rather than a blank.
- `en` holds the translation; a missing key falls back to the key itself.
- The active locale is stored under `kada.locale`. `useT()` returns a stable function, and locale
  changes re-render through the provider.
- Server-rendered output always starts in `zh` because `localStorage` is unreadable during SSR; the
  provider switches after hydration.

When adding UI text: write the Chinese string, wrap it in `t()`, and add the English entry to
`dictionary.ts`. The dictionary is the only place English copy lives.

### 6.2 Theme

The app follows the browser's `prefers-color-scheme` by default and lets the user override it from
Settings → 外观, with a third option that hands control back to the system.

- `data-theme="light|dark"` on `<html>` is the single source of truth. Tailwind's `dark:` variant is
  redefined as an attribute selector, so it works on any browser and the OS setting and an explicit
  choice take the same path.
- **Colours are roles, not shades.** `text-body` and `bg-canvas` resolve per theme; `text-gray-700`
  cannot, because a shade that reads correctly on white is usually wrong on near-black. The scales are
  not inverted wholesale: brand and status colours are fixed, because `bg-indigo-600 text-white` is a
  pair and brightening the indigo for a dark canvas would leave white text on a light blue.
- **A tint is a surface role and both halves move together.** `bg-brand-soft text-brand-ink` is a chip, a
  selected nav item, an icon tile - not a fixed pair - so it is redefined per theme as a unit. Theming
  only one of the two is how a light chip ends up carrying light ink.
- **`gray-50` is the one raw Tailwind neutral remapped for dark mode.** The app uses it purely as a
  neutral surface (`bg-gray-50`, `bg-gray-50/50`, `border-gray-50`, `hover:bg-gray-50`), always under
  `text-*` classes that are themselves themed; left alone it paints white panels and near-white code
  chips on a near-black page. `frontend/scripts/check-theme-css.mjs` asserts both this and the fact that
  `indigo-600`/`red-600` are *not* remapped, so the two rules cannot be confused by accident.
- The sign-in and landing screens are dark in **both** themes. Anything on them that must stay light -
  the selected segment, the language chip - uses literal white rather than a themed surface.
- **The switch is in the top bar.** A one-click sun/moon toggle sits beside the language switcher and pins
  an explicit choice; Settings keeps the three-way control (follow system / light / dark). Before
  hydration the toggle renders the server's assumption and is disabled, because the real value comes from
  `localStorage` and reading it during the first client render is the hydration mismatch `useHydrated`
  exists to prevent.
- An inline `<script>` in the document head sets the attribute while the HTML is parsed. It is
  deliberately **not** `next/script`'s `beforeInteractive`: that queues the body through Next's loader,
  which measured 62ms *after* the first frame and produced a visible light flash. `scripts/check-theme-timing.mjs`
  measures this and fails if the theme lands after the first frame.

Client components that read `localStorage` gate on `useHydrated()` (`src/lib/useHydrated.ts`). Reading a
token or a stored preference straight into render output makes the server's HTML and the client's first
render disagree, and React discards the tree as a hydration mismatch.

## 7. Key flows

### 7.1 Sign-in is phone-only

There is one way in: a phone number and an SMS code. A number that has never been seen is registered on
the spot, so "sign in" and "sign up" are the same request and there is no separate registration flow.

Two other sign-in paths were removed rather than hidden, and the reason is worth recording:

- **WeChat.** The schema had carried `wechat_openid`/`wechat_unionid` from the start and the config had
  `WECHAT_APP_ID`/`WECHAT_APP_SECRET`, but no route ever read them. Implementing it needs an approved
  WeChat Open Platform application, and an individual cannot register one, so the columns stay (existing
  data is untouched) and nothing else does.
- **Email + password.** It duplicated what the phone path already did, added a second credential to
  police, and after the phone flow was hardened it was the only endpoint left that could be attacked
  without an SMS cost. `users.email` and `users.password_hash` remain in the schema so old rows keep
  their data; the API publishes neither, and the route that used to write a name or an email onto the
  profile (`PATCH /api/me`) went with them - the account is the phone number, so there is nothing left
  for a caller to edit.

### 7.2 Login by phone

```text
GET /api/auth/captcha
  → generate a 4-character code and its SVG (internal/infra/captcha, no image or font dependency)
  → store sha256(NORMALISED code) in login_captchas with a 5-minute expiry
  → 200 { captcha_id, image: "data:image/svg+xml;base64,..." }   (Cache-Control: no-store)

POST /api/auth/send-sms-code   { phone, captcha_id, captcha_code }
  → one UPDATE consumes the challenge atomically (unused, unexpired, attempts < 5)
      failure → 400, and attempts is incremented for that id
  → per-phone quotas: 60s cooldown, 10/day            → 429 + Retry-After
  → per-IP quotas: 10/hour, 30/day                    → 429
  → provider sends the code, sha256(code) is stored with a 5-minute expiry
      provider error → the provider code and message are surfaced (see 8.4)
  → 200

POST /api/auth/login-by-phone
  → one UPDATE consumes the pending code atomically (unused, unexpired, attempts < 5)
      failure → increment attempts for the phone, return 401
  → find or create the user by phone
  → sign JWT → 200 { token, user }
```

Three properties of that ordering are deliberate:

1. **The captcha is checked first and is burned either way.** An unauthenticated endpoint that makes the
   server send paid messages is the most abusable thing in this app, so no send can happen without a human
   having solved a challenge - and a challenge that survives a refused send is a challenge an automated
   caller can reuse. The client re-fetches one after every attempt for exactly that reason.
2. **The quotas are independent.** The per-phone pair bounds the damage to one victim; the per-IP pair is
   what notices a script walking a list of numbers, which the per-phone quotas never would (each number is
   used once). The per-IP figures are looser on purpose: a campus or office NAT legitimately shares an
   address.
3. **A quota is a 429, a wrong captcha is a 400.** Returning 500 for both - which the handler used to do -
   tells a client to retry a request that will keep failing, and tells an operator to look for a server
   fault that does not exist.

### 7.3 Recording a click

```text
GET /r/:code
  → resolve the link (cache, then database)
  → build a click event with a random event_id
  → publish to Kafka
      publish fails → write the click row directly (degraded mode, same event_id)
  → redirect the visitor

worker: FetchMessage → WriteClick → CommitMessages
  INSERT click_logs ... ON CONFLICT (event_id) DO NOTHING
      inserted → UPDATE links SET click_count = click_count + 1
      conflict → commit only (the click was already counted)
```

Kafka is at-least-once, so `event_id` is what makes counting exact. The consumer commits offsets
only after a successful write, and a poison message (invalid JSON, foreign-key violation) is dropped
after three attempts rather than blocking the single-partition consumer group forever.

## 8. Cross-cutting decisions

### 8.1 Configuration

One `Config` struct in `backend/config` is parsed once from the environment; nothing else reads
`os.Getenv`. Missing values fall back to development defaults, except in release mode where weak JWT
secrets are rejected outright. `backend/.env.example` and the root `.env.example` document every
variable.

### 8.2 Caching and degradation

Redis is used for the short-code cache and for rate-limit counters, and both **fail open**: if Redis
is unreachable the API keeps serving, caching is skipped, and rate limiting stops rejecting requests
until the client reconnects. Availability of the product is ranked above strictness of the limiter.

### 8.3 Rate limiting

Sliding-window counters in Redis, in three tiers: a global limit for normal API traffic, a strict
limit for auth endpoints, and a higher-throughput limit for redirection. The client IP comes from
`X-Real-IP`, which nginx rewrites. `X-Forwarded-For` is not trusted, because a client can forge it.

### 8.4 Third-party failures are made visible

An SMS provider rejection (unapproved signature, unapproved template, disabled AccessKey) is a
configuration mistake, not a transient failure. The provider's error code and message are logged and
- outside release mode - returned to the caller, because a generic "please try again later" makes the
configuration impossible to diagnose. Internal details are suppressed in release mode.

### 8.5 Security posture

- JWT: HS256 only, expiry required, secret strength enforced in release mode.
- Link targets: only `http` and `https` are accepted, which also blocks `javascript:` and `data:`
  payloads from the guide page.
- Link preview: the fetcher refuses internal networks and cloud metadata addresses (SSRF).
- CSV export: fields are escaped and formula-injection prefixes are neutralised.
- Error responses never echo internal errors.
- Containers run as a non-root user; nginx sets the usual response security headers.
- The AI service refuses its own paths (`/chat`, `/conversations/*`) unless the request carries the
  gateway's shared secret, so being able to reach `127.0.0.1:8000` is not the same as being allowed to
  use it (see 8.6).

### 8.6 AI tools act as the signed-in user

The AI service holds no credential of its own. The Go gateway already forwards the caller's
`Authorization` header, and the tools that read link statistics or create short links pass it on to the
existing `/api/*` routes. Four consequences decide the shape of that:

- **Permission checks live in exactly one place.** The assistant does not parse or validate the JWT and has
  nothing to validate: the handler already knows the user, because the request reached it through the same
  middleware as every other route. A disabled account or an expired token fails a tool call exactly as it
  fails the user's own call, and nothing has to be restarted when that happens.
- **The user id is the authenticated one, and there is no header to spoof.** It used to be a header the
  gateway injected, trustworthy only while the request also carried a shared secret that no other local
  process knew - and that second half is what made forging the header impossible rather than merely
  unlikely. In this process the value comes from the middleware's context, so the whole exchange is gone:
  no header, no secret, and no way for a local process to impersonate a user.
- **The credential is per request, not per process.** The user id travels in the request context, so two
  users served by the same process cannot see each other's data - and the same fact is what lets one
  agent, built once at startup, serve every account. (The Python service kept it in a `ContextVar` bound
  by the chat route; that is the same idea, and the reason its business tools could not live in the MCP
  subprocess, whose single shared stdio session has no request to belong to.)
- **A failed tool degrades the answer, not the request.** Tools return their failure as text (an HTTP
  status, a missing credential) so the model can explain it, in the same spirit as RAG retrieval falling

## 9. Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | local `kada` database | PostgreSQL DSN |
| `DB_AUTO_MIGRATE` | `true` | Apply the schema on API startup |
| `REDIS_URL` | `redis://localhost:6379` | Cache and rate limiting (optional) |
| `JWT_SECRET` | weak dev value | Token signing; must be strong in release mode |
| `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` | `720h` | Token lifetime |
| `PORT` | `8080` | API listen port |
| `GIN_MODE` | `debug` | `release` silences dev output and enables strict checks |
| `API_BASE_URL` | `https://kada.click` | Base for generated short URLs |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` | CORS and redirects |
| `SMS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `SMS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET` | empty | Alibaba Cloud credentials; empty disables real sending (and, in production, sign-in) |
| `SMS_SIGN_NAME`, `SMS_TEMPLATE_CODE` | empty | The system-granted signature and template from the PNVS console; both are required, see below |
| `KAFKA_BROKERS` | empty | Comma-separated brokers; empty disables Kafka (clicks are written directly) |
| `KAFKA_TOPIC` | `clicks` | Click event topic |
| `VITE_API_URL` | `""` (same origin) | API base for the browser, fixed at build time |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | empty | The assistant's chat model key (DeepSeek, OpenAI-compatible API) |
| `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` | empty | Aliyun Bailian key for the knowledge base embeddings |
| `AI_CHAT_MODEL`, `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`, `AI_MAX_TOKENS`, `AI_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `deepseek-flash`, `https://api.deepseek.com`, `8192`, `text-embedding-v3` | Optional overrides for the four values above |

`SMS_SIGN_NAME` has no default on purpose. It used to fall back to the literal `kada`, and for this
deployment that is in fact the account's real signature - which is precisely what made the outage
invisible: with the signature always supplied by a default, the missing template code (see 9.1) still
produced a constructed sender, and the failure came back as an Aliyun rejection rather than as "this is
not configured". Empty now means "not configured", and the startup log says so. The cost is one explicit
setting: `SMS_SIGN_NAME=kada` for this account.

None of these secrets are set on the server by hand any more. The deploy job writes them from GitHub
repository secrets with `deploy/upsert-env.sh`, as its **first** step, before a single service is replaced.

Every one of them is `--require`d, and the check reads **the file**, not the repository secrets. That
placement is the whole design: an AI key or an SMS credential that is missing fails the deployment while
the previous build keeps serving, and it fails before anything on the host has been touched. Reading the
file rather than the secrets is also what keeps a hand-configured host deployable - `--set` with an empty
value leaves an existing line alone, so a value that only exists on the server satisfies the check, and a
check that looked at `secrets.*` instead would reject a deployment that was going to work.

The SMS credentials were briefly exempt from that (`--warn`, i.e. report and continue), on the argument
that the Aliyun signature and template have to be approved in the console before they exist at all and
blocking every deploy until then would stop unrelated fixes from shipping. That argument lost: phone plus
SMS code is the only way to sign in, so a host without them serves a site nobody can log into, and in
release mode the code is never written to the log. A deployment that would produce that is better refused.
What survives from the episode is a runner-side note (never a failure) saying that CI does not *manage*
these four values yet - useful because whether they are set here or only on the host is invisible until the
machine is rebuilt.

The assistant reads these from the same environment as the rest of the API (see
`backend/.env.example`), and in production the deploy job writes them into `/opt/kada/backend/.env`.
Missing keys do not stop the process: without the chat key every question is answered with a
configuration message, and without the embedding key the assistant answers from the model alone, with no
retrieved context.

> There is no service token and no second process. The tools act as the signed-in user because they run
> in this process with the user id from the request (see 8.6) - the credential the Python service used to
> carry, the internal secret that authenticated the hop to it, and the second database it kept its
> conversations in are all gone with it.

### 9.1 SMS verification

Sign-up by phone uses Alibaba Cloud **PNVS "SMS verification"** (`dypnsapi.aliyuncs.com`), not the
separate SMS product (`dysmsapi`). That distinction decides the configuration:

- It is the one SMS route open to **individually verified** accounts. The SMS product stopped accepting
  personal self-use qualifications, so personal signatures and templates can no longer be approved there.
- The account gets **one** system-granted signature and **one** system-granted template, read from the
  PNVS console (**短信认证 → 概览**). For this account they are the signature `恒创联众` and the template
  `100001`, whose content is `您的验证码为${code}，…以上验证码${min}分钟内有效…`. They cannot be created or
  edited, and they must be used as a pair: a granted signature with a custom template is rejected, and so
  is the reverse.
- The two products keep **separate registries**, and the same string means nothing in the other one. This
  was settled for this account rather than argued: the SMS product's own `QuerySmsSignList` and
  `QuerySmsTemplateList` both answer `TotalCount: 0`, so no signature and no template of that product
  exists here, while PNVS answers `isv.INVALID_PARAMETERS` / 签名或者模版无效 for anything that is not the
  granted pair.
- `SMS_SIGN_NAME` and `SMS_TEMPLATE_CODE` have **no defaults**. They used to fall back to the granted pair
  hardcoded in `aliyun.go`, which is why sends worked before anything was configured at all - and why an
  unset variable looked harmless. Startup now names the missing setting instead, and phone sign-up stays
  disabled until it is set.
- The API contract is not the obvious one either. `SendSmsVerifyCode` **generates the code itself**: the
  template variable must carry the placeholder `##code##` for Aliyun to substitute, and the generated code
  only comes back because `ReturnVerifyCode` is set. A code of our own in that field is rejected with
  `isv.INVALID_PARAMETERS` before any message is sent. `CodeLength` is pinned to 6 because its default is
  4 while the sign-in form, the stored hash and the input field all expect six.
- `SchemeName` is left out, so the provider uses the default service. It is an account-specific name whose
  documented default is exactly that, and the hardcoded `SMS` the request used to carry was a guess that
  nothing had ever checked - probed against the live account, the granted pair answers `OK` as soon as the
  parameter is absent. `CheckSmsVerifyCode` omits it for the same reason: a check has to name the scheme
  the code was issued under.
- The console describes the granted pair as being for **API 联调** and requires test phone numbers to be
  bound before 联调 starts (up to five), so the granted pair is what makes the flow testable for free;
  sending to arbitrary numbers needs a signature and a template of its own.
- The provider enforces a send interval of its own and reports it as a business code on an HTTP 200
  (`biz.FREQUENCY` here, `isv.BUSINESS_LIMIT_CONTROL` on the SMS product). That is a wait, not a
  misconfiguration, and it is not reported as one: the sender flags it, the service turns it into the same
  quota it uses for its own limits, and the client gets a 429 with a retry-after rather than a 400 carrying
  an English provider code into a Chinese form. The codes are matched on the substrings `FREQUENCY` and
  `LIMIT`, because a fixed list would quietly stop matching the next variant.
- The PNVS console, its data, and its package are all separate from the SMS product: sending is billed
  against a PNVS "SMS verification" package, which the SMS product's free trial does not cover.

**Where the working pair went (worth reading before debugging "SMS stopped working").**

SMS really did work in production once, and the reason it stopped is on the record:

1. `05eda08 feat: add Alibaba Cloud SMS verification` moved the pair out of the source and recorded the
   **wrong** values in `backend/.env.example`: signature `kada` and a template code of the form `SMS_…`.
   Neither exists in either registry of this account. Nothing appeared to break, because the source still
   held the correct pair as a hardcoded fallback and kept using it.
2. `8420bd9 refactor: move the backend from pgx to GORM with AutoMigrate` blanked that whole SMS section of
   the example file while rewriting it, so the only recorded copy of the template code disappeared. Still
   nothing broke, for the same reason.
3. `fbc1763 fix: fail on an unset SMS signature instead of substituting one` removed that fallback, which
   was right on its own terms - a hardcoded account-specific pair has no business being a default. But the
   host had no signature configured, so sending stopped, and the values then copied in by hand came from
   the example file, which is to say the wrong ones. From there every send was rejected as an invalid
   signature or template, and the rejection read like a broken account rather than a wrong pair.
4. What ended it was reading the console instead of the repository: **短信认证 → 概览** lists the granted
   signature and template, and a signature probe against both products showed the recorded values belong to
   neither. The lesson is not "the value was lost" but "a wrong value was recorded as if it were the
   account's, and nothing ever checked it against the provider".

The AccessKey pair is **not in the repository and never was** (it is only ever read from the environment; a
history search for the `LTAI` prefix finds nothing but accidental substrings inside base64 hashes in
`go.sum`). The signature and template code are account-specific and read from the environment too, and
`backend/.env.example` deliberately keeps them empty so a copied example file cannot pretend to be
configured. They are named above because they are not secrets - they are visible in the console - and
because refusing to name them is what turned one wrong assumption into an outage that took a console
screenshot to end.

## 10. Deployment

Three supported shapes:

1. **Docker Compose** (`docker compose up -d`): nginx, API, worker, frontend, PostgreSQL, Redis and
   Kafka on one host. Suitable for a single server or local development.
2. **systemd + released binaries** (`deploy/`): the API and worker run as native processes, with
   PostgreSQL, Redis and Kafka provided separately. This is what the GitHub Actions deploy job uses:
   it builds the binaries, applies the schema with `bin/migrate`, restarts `kada-api`, and verifies
   the health endpoint, rolling back to the previous binary if the service does not come up.
3. **The assistant inside the API process.** It used to be a Python container of its own with its own
   database, its own env file and its own deploy script; it is a package of the Go binary now
   (`internal/assistant`), which is why none of those exist any more. The knowledge base is a table in
   the application's database, built by `cmd/ai-ingest`, and the chat, retrieval and tool code all runs
   in the API process - so a host has one fewer service to run, and one fewer way for two processes to
   disagree about who is asking.

   The knowledge base needs the pgvector extension in the database it lives in. `cmd/ai-ingest` runs
   `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector` itself, and says so plainly when the extension is not
   available at all; on a fresh compose volume `deploy/postgres/initdb/01-enable-vector.sql` does the
   same thing, because `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` only runs on first initialisation.

   The provider keys reach the host from **GitHub repository secrets**, written into
   `/opt/kada/backend/.env` by `deploy/upsert-env.sh` as the first step of the deploy, before any service
   is replaced. That file is the fix for a whole class of outage: both "the AI page is broken" and "the
   SMS code never arrives" turned out to be an empty line in a file on the server that nothing had ever
   checked. A `--require`d key that is missing fails the deployment while the previous build is still
   serving, and an empty `--set` leaves an existing hand-configured value alone.

The deploy job applies the schema **before** replacing the binary, so a failed migration leaves the
previous version running.

The bytes reach the host as **one tarball over one ssh stream**, and that transfer is bounded: a
per-attempt timeout, three attempts, and a size check before anything is unpacked. It used to be
`appleboy/scp-action` with six sources, one of them a directory glob, and the step took whatever the
runner-to-host link decided - 26 seconds in one run, 8 minutes in another and 27 minutes in a third, with
the action's own command timeout (10m) not bounding the last one. A stalled transfer is now a failure that
leaves the host untouched instead of a run held open until it happens to succeed, and the step that
follows starts from a complete tree under `/tmp/kada-deploy`. The frontend is built **once**: the
`frontend-build` job already produces the bundle with the deployment's own `VITE_API_URL`, so the
deploy job receives it as an artifact rather than setting up Node and building the same commit again.

Verification happens in two places, which is deliberate:

- **On the host**, during the deploy step: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/health`. This is the
  authoritative check and the one that can fail the deploy. It depends on nothing but the API
  answering, so a TLS, DNS or network problem cannot be reported as a failed deployment.
- **From the runner**, afterwards: a smoke test of the public origin over HTTPS, its `/api/health`,
  the frontend, and the plain-HTTP entry point (which nginx redirects). It covers DNS, TLS and nginx as
  a visitor sees them, and it is **advisory**: a datacenter IP can be refused by the host's edge (this
  deployment answered `Connection reset by peer` during a TLS handshake while the same URL returned 200
  elsewhere), and gating a release on that would make green builds a matter of luck. Its result is
  reported as a warning and in the run summary, never as a failed deploy.

  The step absorbs a refusal rather than letting `curl` raise it. `continue-on-error` keeps it from
  failing the run, but on its own it still lets a non-zero `curl` surface as an error annotation and a
  red X next to a deployment that succeeded. The step therefore always exits 0, writes what happened to
  `verify-status.txt` and `verify-body.txt`, and the step after it reports those. A refusal is a fact to
  record, not an error to raise.

  Two shell details are load-bearing there, and `scripts/verify-deploy-step.test.js` runs this step
  against a stubbed `curl` to keep them honest: the exit status is read from a plain assignment, because
  `if ! curl` reports the status of the negation (a refusal recorded as `curl 0`) and `local rc=$?` reads
  the status of `local`; and only `/api/health` is asserted to carry a healthy payload, since the
  frontend serves HTML and asserting the same payload on it fails a perfectly healthy site.

The public origin defaults to `https://kada.click`. Override it with the `SITE_URL` **repository
variable** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables) when a deployment serves a
different name. It is a variable rather than a secret because the name is already public in the
certificate transparency logs, the DNS records and `nginx/nginx-prod.conf` - and because a deployment
step that requires manual setup is a failure mode of its own.

## 11. Testing

| Layer | Style |
|---|---|
| HTTP handlers | Table-driven tests with fake service implementations; no database |
| Services | Pure-function tests (validation, short-code generation, CSV escaping) |
| Schema | `internal/domain/entity` asserts table names, columns, unique indexes and delete rules against the GORM schema |
| Query shapes | Dry-run GORM sessions assert the generated SQL for the dynamic and bulk statements |
| Frontend | Vitest for pure helpers (starfield geometry, ophiuchus lines, utilities) |
| Assistant | Fakes for the model and the knowledge base, but the real Eino agent with the real tools: one test drives a model that asks for a tool and asserts which user the tool acted for, another drives a model that never stops asking and asserts the step limit holds |

Run everything with `cd backend && go test ./... -count=1 -race` and `cd frontend && npm test`; CI
additionally runs `go vet`, `golangci-lint`,
`tsc --noEmit` and the production build on every pull request. The assistant is tested where it runs
rather than as a container: the failure it has to catch - a model or an embedding call that only breaks
when a question arrives - is a fake model or a retrieval error in `internal/assistant`, not an image that
starts.

## 12. Known limitations

These are deliberate trade-offs, not oversights:

- **Analytics are computed on demand.** `click_logs` is queried directly; there is no rollup table.
  Acceptable at the current volume, and the obvious first thing to change if the tables grow.
- **Kafka has one partition.** Click ordering is preserved and the throughput ceiling is a single
  consumer; a single-partition consumer group is also what makes the poison-message logic simple.
- **AutoMigrate cannot express every future change.** Renames, type narrowing and data backfills need
  a hand-written statement; there is no down-migration path.
- **No background job scheduler.** Expiry is evaluated at read time rather than by a sweeper.
- **Single-tenant deployment.** There is no organisation/role model beyond `workspaces`, which group
  links but do not grant access to other users.
- **Rate-limit state is per-Redis-instance**, so a multi-instance deployment needs a shared Redis
  (which is the intended topology).
