// "Upload the deploy bundle" steps out of ci.yml and runs them, so each outcome is observed instead of
// assumed.
//
//   node scripts/verify-deploy-step.test.js
//
// The verification cases are the ones that actually appeared in CI (35: the edge reset the TLS handshake,
// 6: the host did not resolve) plus the healthy case and a reachable-but-unhealthy API. It asserts that
// the verify step never fails the job, that it records the right status, and that the report step warns
// only when the smoke test genuinely did not pass.
//
// The SMS cases assert the property that makes that step safe to ship: it reports that CI does not manage
// the credentials, and still exits 0. It must not fail the job, because the value only has to reach the
// host's .env by some route and a hand-configured host deploys perfectly well - a step that failed here
// would reject a deployment that was going to work, which is worse than saying nothing.
//
// The upload cases stub `ssh` and drive the three things it can do wrong: complete the transfer, complete
// it after failures, deliver a short stream while still exiting 0, and refuse outright. What they pin is
// that a bad link stays bounded - three attempts, then a failure with the host untouched - because the
// step this replaced could sit in a stalled transfer for half an hour (see the comment in ci.yml), and
// that the bundle still carries every path the deploy step reads.
//
// Generates scripts/.verify-deploy-out/ and runs it with bash. Git Bash cannot run under the default
// sandbox (it needs a signal pipe), so this looks for WSL bash first and falls back to Git Bash.
