 * Two-letter marks for the capsule's segments.

 * Language codes rather than names ("中文" / "English"): a code is the same two characters in both locales,

 * changes. The full name is still what a screen reader announces, because "ZH" alone is a code, not a word.

/**
 * Language switcher: a capsule with one segment per locale and a thumb that slides to the active one.
 *
 * It shows the language you are *in*, not the one you would switch to. A single button has to name its
 * target to read as an action; a segmented control shows both options at once, and there the highlighted
 * segment is the state - which is what everyone already expects it to mean.
 *
 * No flags. A flag names a country, not a language: English is not owned by the United Kingdom, and the
 * marks this replaces had to be hand-drawn SVG to survive Windows, where emoji flags degrade to letters.
 * "ZH"/"EN" says the same thing in less space, in no country's colors, and is the one thing both locales
 * can read.
 *
 * The thumb is the app's existing "selected" idiom - `bg-indigo-600 text-white shadow-sm`, the same fixed
 * pair the pagination and the AI tabs use. It is deliberately not a themed surface: brand fills are not
 * re-themed (see globals.css), so this keeps its contrast in both themes with no `dark:` variant. Only the
 * track follows the theme.
 *
 * `onDark` is for the landing and sign-in screens, which are dark in both themes. There the track has to be
 * a light wash over the page rather than a themed chip: a themed surface follows the page into black and
 * takes the control with it, which is what happened when the sign-in screen's selected segment became one.
 *
 * Two segments, deliberately. The thumb is half the track and parks at one end or the other, and Tailwind
 * only emits the translate utilities it can read literally - so a third locale means rewriting this, not
 * just adding to LOCALES.
