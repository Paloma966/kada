 * A new tab, not a navigation: the app is what the visitor came for, and a same-tab jump to GitHub is the
 * one link on the page with no way back to the dashboard. The accessible name is the brand itself, the same
 * word in both locales, so its dictionary entry is an identity pair rather than a translation - it is there
 * to keep every visible label in one list, not because there is anything to translate.
 *
 * The mark is drawn here rather than imported. lucide-react is the set every other control is built from,
 * but its 1.x releases dropped the brand marks - the installed 1.24.0 ships no `github` icon at all - and
 * the alternatives were worse: a solid Octocat sits visibly heavier than a 16px stroked glyph beside the
 * theme toggle and the capsule, and a second icon package for one symbol is not worth a dependency. What
 * is vendored is the outline lucide used to ship, so the stroke weight and the round caps are the ones the
 * rest of the bar is drawn with.
 *
 * `onDark` works like the capsule's: the landing and sign-in pages are dark in both themes, so here the
 * control has to be a light wash over the page rather than a themed chip.
