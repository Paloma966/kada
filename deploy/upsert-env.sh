# Why this exists: the AI keys and the SMS credentials used to be typed into a file on the server by hand,
# and nothing anywhere failed when they were forgotten. The service started, passed its health check, and
# then failed every request that mattered - "the AI page is broken" and "the SMS code never arrives" were
# both, in the end, an empty line in a file nobody had looked at. The values now come from GitHub Secrets
# through CI, and --require turns "forgot to configure it" into a failed deployment that says which key is
# missing, before any service on the host has been touched.
#
# --set with an EMPTY value is a no-op: it leaves whatever the file already holds. That is what makes it
# safe to run on a host that was configured by hand before the secrets existed - and --require is what
# stops "empty means skip" from quietly passing when nothing is there at all.
#
# --require also decides *where* the check belongs. It reads the file as it will be after the sync, rather
# than testing whether a repository secret happens to be set, and that is deliberate: a host configured by
# hand keeps deploying normally, because the value only has to reach this file by some route. A check that
# looked at the secrets instead would fail a deployment that was going to work.
#
# The value is never passed through sed: an API key can contain `/`, `&` or `\`, every one of which sed
# would treat as part of its own syntax. The line is removed with grep and appended with printf instead.

Add them as repository secrets (Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions): the
deployment refuses to continue rather than start a service that cannot work, and it
refuses before touching anything on this host. A value already present in this file
also satisfies the check - --set with an empty value leaves it alone, so a host that
was configured by hand keeps deploying without the secret being set here.

Expected secrets:
  DEEPSEEK_API_KEY    chat model key           -> DEEPSEEK_API_KEY in backend/.env
  
  SMS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, SMS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET, SMS_SIGN_NAME, SMS_TEMPLATE_CODE -> backend/.env
      (phone + SMS code is the only sign-in method, so without these NOBODY CAN SIGN IN)
